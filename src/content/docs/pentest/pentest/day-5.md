### **Key Topics:**
- 🔍 **Introduction to Real-World Pentesting:**
  - **What is Pentesting?** Pentesting involves testing systems and applications for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. It’s about thinking like a hacker to help improve security.
  - **Why It Matters:** Finding and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers do is crucial for protecting sensitive information and maintaining trust.

- 🛠️ **Practical Skills: From Recon to Exploitation:**
  - **Reconnaissance:** Start by gathering information about your target. Use tools like **Nmap** to discover open ports and services.
  - **Scanning:** Next, scan the target for vulnerabilities. Look for weak points that could be exploited.
  - **Exploitation:** Once you find a vulnerability, use it to gain access. This is where you’ll put your knowledge of tools like **Metasploit** into practice.
